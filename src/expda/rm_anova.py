"""Stage 2b - repeated-measures contrasts for within-subject level families.

Some variables in a dataset are not independent measurements: they are the
same construct sampled at several ordered levels within one test session for
the same subject (e.g. contrast sensitivity at six spatial frequencies, ERG
amplitude at nine light intensities). Testing each level separately with
``inference.compare_two_groups`` and then correcting with BH-FDR treats them
as an unordered bag of variables, which (a) is statistically weaker than it
needs to be — it throws away the correlation between adjacent levels instead
of using it — and (b) still tests every level whether or not the deficit
actually depends on the level at all.

This module runs a single 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA per family instead
(Condition x Level, both within-subject), and only drills down level-by-level
when there is a reason to: **the per-level post-hoc runs if and only if the
Condition x Level interaction is itself significant** (GG-corrected). That
is the gate — evidence the effect's *shape* differs by level — before any
levels are compared individually. A significant Condition main effect with a
non-significant interaction is reported as a uniform, level-independent
shift and is not decomposed further; doing so would reintroduce exactly the
unguarded multiple-comparison problem this module exists to avoid.

Engine selection (per family, all three omnibus rows together — never
per-term, so the table never mixes p-values computed two different ways):

    all (Condition, Level) cells pass Shapiro-Wilk (alpha=0.05) and n >= 5,
    and Levene across cells (center='median') passes
        -> parametric ``pingouin.rm_anova``, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected
    otherwise
        -> Aligned Rank Transform (ART, Wobbrock 2011), adapted for the
           within-subject case

A between-subjects ART fallback (no subject term at all) would be the wrong
model here. This module's version is adapted for the repeated-measures case
instead: subject enters the closed-form decomposition as an
additive blocking term (matching the additivity ``pingouin.rm_anova`` itself
assumes — no subject x factor interactions), so the paired structure
survives into the aligned response, then the same ``pingouin.rm_anova`` is
refit on the aligned-and-ranked values to read off that one term's F/p — one
alignment per term, per Wobbrock's procedure, never the same ranked column
reused across terms. See ``_align_and_rank``'s docstring for the exact
decomposition and a double-counting bug it replaced.

Post-hoc (only when gated open): the same paired-contrast dispatch as
``inference.compare_two_groups`` (paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank, by
per-level normality — this per-level pretest is unaffected by which engine
the omnibus used), one comparison per level, corrected across levels with
Holm-Bonferroni (``multicomparison.holm_adjust`` — exact family-wise
control, no independence assumption, appropriate for adjacent, correlated
levels).

Both outputs carry the assumption checks that gated the engine/test choice
as leading columns, before the F/p or test/p columns they gated — the
omnibus table's normality/homoscedasticity describe the whole family (one
value per family, repeated on all three rows, since the engine was chosen
once for the family, not per term); the post-hoc table's normality is
per-level, per the same pretest inference.compare_two_groups uses. A
starred assumption significance means that assumption was rejected, not
that a real effect was found — same convention as inference.py.

A family is a named set of columns in one dataset sharing a single ordered
axis (frequency, intensity, ...). Not every variable belongs to one:
qualitatively distinct named measurements (e.g. the ERG named waves Scotopic
b / Mixed a / Mixed b / Photopic b / OPs / Flicker) are not levels of a
common factor and are deliberately left to the existing per-variable
``compare_two_groups`` + BH-FDR path.

    significance. Caught by cross-checking against a family with a known
